Do you know how to move between directories and read files in the shell? Start the container, `ssh` to it, and then `ls` once connected to begin. Login via `ssh` as `ctf-player` with the password, `a13b7f9d`

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

Finding a cheatsheet for bash would be really helpful!
